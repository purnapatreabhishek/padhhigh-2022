            We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your Information. We provide physical,

            How Long Do We Retain User Data?

            Currently, we plan to retain user data while an account is active and for at least three years afterward. We
            may alter this practice according to legal and business requirements. For example, we may lengthen the
            retention period for some data if needed to comply with law or voluntary codes of conduct. Unless otherwise
            prohibited, we may shorten the retention period for some types of data if needed to free up storage space.
